ldesc: "Kexi is an integrated data management application. It can be 
used for creating database schemas, inserting data, performing queries, 
and processing data. Forms can be created to provide a custom interface 
to your data. All database objects - tables, queries and forms - are 
stored in the database, making it easy to share data and design."
